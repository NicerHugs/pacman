- handle LEVEL_COMPLETE action when there is no next level (tell user they won);
- draw new level and return bodies to starting location after winning level
- modify counter action for pac (power counter) and ghosts (frozen counter)
- ghosts should respond to MOVE_BODIES action
- handle pac and ghost collisions
- increase pac's powerCount on superpellet chomp
- currently pac will only get a new life if his score exactly equals a multiple of 1000, fix that.
